I mean, all of those countries. I remember there was a fellow that we, oh, we went in the subway and the subways are beautiful there. And we always kept the name of the hotel written, I guess, in Russian. So if we got lost, somebody could help us. And I remember this fellow took us through the subway and took us to the top, you know, to the surface, the ground. And we wanted to ask him to come and, you know, have a coffee or something. He just, you know, disappeared. Another time we were taking a bus, nobody would sit with us, but this one fellow would help, would nod, you know, when we were to get off. It was interesting. I guess the people, maybe they were curious about us, maybe they were afraid of us, but it certainly was a wonderful experience. But next time I go, I always said I'd take some food with me. And of course there was a monitor sitting on each floor where we stayed, and I made sure that we had our own room and that we didn't have to worry about other people's rooms because it wasn't like you're going to be in your room all day long. And maybe they were kind of –I don't know –afraid? I don't know what they were. But anyway it was a good experience in that we saw and learned a lot and enjoyed our stay, even though it was hard to eat sometimes. Oh, another thing is the person who was taking the money was cutting the bread, was dishing the eggs, was making whatever. It was so slow that we were in like a cafeteria in the breakfast room. So slow because one person seemed to be doing everything and then they cut it off and then they put it on top of their bread. And I think that's what happened with this.

Then we went on, I don't know how we ended up in Oslo, maybe the train. We were in Oslo a number of days. Then we took the train to Denmark, and the train was uncoupled because it was on a ferry. And we were in each one of these Scandinavian countries maybe about four or five days, and I remember one time in Denmark, we were just so tired, we never even, we took a tour bus, we never even got off the bus. I think it was doing too much in little time. Well anyway my friend had a French... She's French . She had a friend in Paris, so we flew to Paris, we stayed in Paris a number of days, then we took the plane back to her family's home in Akechon, which is on the coast, and we just stayed there at her home, lovely home. Her father was a veterinarian, nice little garden and just did things in the area and didn't care about doing too much. And then I flew back to the United States for my first time.

I mean, to, um, I guess have more time to relax while traveling that we, we did a lot. I learned that. But of course adventure that I wanted to see more and, um, I can't remember whether that summer then I met my friend in London. I can't remember whether it was that summer or the following summer. I met my another teacher friend, American and I met her in England and we toured a bit, but I guess then we went to the Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam and I missed the flight, I remember. And it might have been the following summer. Anyway, I was in shops or something and she wanted to get off the plane. So I went to her house and she said, you know what? You're going to be able to do this. And they wouldn't let her off the plane. But anyway, she polluted the Schiphol Airport. No, it was the following summer, but I'll continue with this anyway, because she was buying a car at the Schiphol Airport and we were going to drive back to Iran. And anyway, I got on the next plane and she had a message for me. Stay right here. Don't move whatever. Anyway we met and we had some friends in the Netherlands. I think we stayed there a couple of days and then she got just visiting. So that was really nice to see her again, but it's been a long time since I've seen her again so it's been really nice to see her again.

I remember we stayed at the Hilton and then we went across Turkey, we went down to Cappadocia. We did sites there. We got to the border, Iran and Turkey, and you could see Mount Ararat there. And I believe...I get mixed up on some of these trips.

Well, I'm not, I don't know, smaller towns. Anyway, they would take us into the kitchen, and we'd point, and then no matter what it seemed like they pointed, it was always turned out to be eggplant. And I never liked eggplant growing up, but I learned to like it in Turkey. And another thing is sometimes if they didn't take us into the kitchen, we'd just look to see what other people were eating and point and have them point on the menu what it was or tell the waiter that's what we'd have. But anyway, it was fun. We had a good time. And we made it. Actually, then later on I'll tell you about driving out of Turkey, driving out of Iran when I was leaving Iran after three years in the army and then going back to Turkey for a year and a half to be able to get back home again. So I'll stop there for that on that excursion. But it was wonderful. Oh, we were in Vienna, too, and we were in Munich, and we did sightseeing in some of those places and Istanbul and so on.",

He was going up to see his relatives or somebody had died and he said, look, you stay in that schoolhouse. I'm going to stay out and watch what happens. So we stayed in the schoolhouse along with many other people who were traveling. And the next morning we walked down to a lake or a river, I think it was a river, a small river, and kind of washed up and cleaned up. And then I remember we ate eggs, hard-boiled eggs on the road with some vendor. And then we continued on our way and we were the first car through because I think we were a little Volkswagen and a lot of the other vehicles were larger. And then we stayed on in Dow, oh, and drove into the town, oh everybody gathered around our car. And when we were in Pakistan, some people had asked us if we would take some letters and give them to somebody in the city. So I said no thanks. And they said no thanks? They didn't say anything about it? No they didn't say anything about it? No they didn't say anything about it? No they didn't say anything about it? No they didn't say anything about it? No they didn't say nothing about it? No they did not know what that was saying. No but then we stayed on in Dow Oh and we drove into the town oh everybody you know gathered around our car and when we were in Pakistan some people had asked us if we would take some letters and drop give them to somebody in Srinagar which we did. And we stayed on a houseboat on Dow Lake which is the thing to do and so anyway, we stayed there, we were there a couple of days, probably two nights and then we went back down and drove back to Iran and we had lunch in the car. We went through the Khyber Pass in Pakistan into Afghanistan. We drove through the Khyber Pass. That was memorable. All these plaques on the walls of the mountains.",

And I was doing some embroidery work and whatever road the Americans made, I can't remember which one, it was smoother riding for me to do my needlework. So anyway, we stayed in Kandahar and I remember we, in the hotel, the fellow bringing a load of wood in to our room so we could be warm. And anyway, we continued on to Herat and crossed the border. We were going through a lot of different places. We had a lot of people that were coming from all over the world who had been living there for years. And some of these places where we stayed when we were staying at these big hotels, we didn't know how to get back into town because we'd see that we didn't know how to get out of town. We'd see signs for the hotel to get to the hotel, but then there was nobody telling us where the signs were to get on live. So, we'd take a kid from the hotel and he would ride with us and then we would give him some of our money to take a bus back when we got to our road that we were taking.",

And I'd have to say to my friend, you can pass, but hurry. Another experience we had, I remember being somewhere. Gosh, I have to think about this because I remember the hotel didn't have any room for us and maybe it was Bulgaria or I don't know what country it was, but and there was a fellow sitting in the lobby and the man at the desk said well we don't have rooms but this fellow has rooms at his house and I don't know whether he was on a bicycle or whether we gave him a ride but anyway we went to this guy's house and he had like two people sitting in the lobby and he said well we don't have rooms but this fellow has rooms you know at his house. And I don't know whether he was on a bicycle or with it, we gave him a ride, but anyway, we went to this gated sort of complex. Well it wasn't it was just probably a farm with a gate on it and we stayed in a room and there were other people, you know, who were like that too. So I think that's the kind of thing that I would say is really important to keep in mind when you're talking about the environment. And there were other people cars were parked there and I remember we had each had our twin bed and I remember in the bathroom was like down the hall. It was kind of rooms off like a hallway and I remember the next morning they offered us peppermint schnapps, which is what you get for breakfast. And my friend didn't drink hers, but I drank hers. And the other cars that were there that night, those people were already in their car. So we had to go back and forth between them and then we went to the next one where they had a little bit of a party going on at the end of it. And some – I can't remember a lot of this – but there were troops moving. We were – someplace where we were, we had – that we were on the highway for hours, it seemed. People were getting off buses and walking to the town. And they were moving troops. Somebody was moving troops somewhere and we had to wait until they moved these troops. And you know, I kept – somewhere I have, I think, a journal or a diary about all of this, but I can't find it. But I remember that also. And we weren't really – we did a lot of driving, so we weren't real big tourists. And I remember the director of our school, he was an English fellow – he said, I didn't expect to see you two again, but we made it.",

Very, very hospitable. Very kind. And I was there, of course, when times were different. I didn't have to wear a shador or I didn't have to cover my head. I could drive a car. You could buy liquor there. They had shams, which was a beer. I had freedom there. And the hospitality of the Iranians is just so wonderful that you can go out and get some good stuff for free and then you can go back home and do your job again in the morning. And it was funny because one time I was in London and I can't remember which time and I was walking. I went over to London to see a friend of mine that I had met in Iran and he was English anyway.

Anyway later that night, he was – I don't know what he was doing there exactly. Anyway we made arrangements because I was over there seeing another fellow and we made arrangements to meet about 9 o'clock and we'd go out and we were out and we were sitting on the curb till about 2 o'clock in the morning just having a nice time and when I went back to – when I went – returned to Iran and he returned to Iran, you know, we'd get together but that was later. Anyway the other friend that I was visiting came to pick me up and he said, you know what? You're not going to be able to do it. So I'm like, okay. And of course I'm still sleeping because I was out so late the night before but anyway, I spent the day and then I guess flew back to Iran or maybe that was when my friend was there. We went to Schiphol Airport. I can't remember because I was there a couple of times. I think actually I probably went to Iran by myself. Flew around by myself and then",

And so that's how we got started with our relationship. And so I was very shy about it because we were both in high school and she was the editor of the newspaper in high school and I took a different direction, maybe that was part of it.
