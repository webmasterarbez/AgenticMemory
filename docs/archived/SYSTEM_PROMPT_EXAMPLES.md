## Best Practices for All System Prompts

### Structure
- **Clear sections** with headers (#)
- **Concise bullets** for lists
- **Examples** for clarity
- **Constraints** clearly defined
- **Escalation criteria** explicit

### Length
- Keep under 1000 words total
- Most effective: 500-800 words
- LLMs pay more attention to beginning and end

### Testing
1. Test with new caller (no memory)
2. Test with returning caller (rich memory)
3. Test edge cases (angry, confused, off-topic)
4. Monitor for hallucinations
5. Iterate based on real conversations

### Memory Integration
- Acknowledge memory context exists
- Give examples of natural references
- Don't mention "database" or "system"
- Use search_memory tool strategically

### Tone
- Match your brand
- Be consistent
- Show personality
- Stay professional

## Integration with AgenticMemory

All these prompts work seamlessly with AgenticMemory because:

1. **Memory Context Prepended**: Your prompt receives caller context automatically
2. **Search Memory Tool**: Available for specific queries
3. **Dynamic Variables**: Use {{caller_name}}, {{memory_count}}, etc.
4. **Natural References**: Prompts teach agent to reference memories naturally

**Example Flow**:
```
[Call Starts]
→ ElevenLabs requests ClientData
→ AgenticMemory returns memories + first_message
→ ElevenLabs prepends memory context to your system prompt:
   "CALLER CONTEXT: This caller has 15 previous interactions..."
→ Your system prompt appears after context
→ Agent uses both context + your instructions
```
